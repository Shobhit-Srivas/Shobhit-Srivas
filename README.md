##  👨‍💻 About Me:

Hello! 👋 I’m Shobhit Srivastava, a dedicated and enthusiastic computer science learner currently pursuing a Master of Computer Applications (MCA) 🎓. I have a strong passion for software development, problem-solving, and building real-world applications 💻🚀. My goal is to secure a challenging role in a progressive, technology-driven organization where I can apply my skills, learn continuously, and grow professionally 🌱.

I have hands-on experience with programming languages such as C, Java (Basic), and Python 🧠📌, along with a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 🌐. I actively practice Data Structures, Algorithms, and logical problem-solving, and I have solved 400+ basic and easy-level problems on GeeksforGeeks 📊✅. Additionally, solving 500+ problems on CodeChef has helped me improve my coding consistency, efficiency, and logical thinking 🔍⚙️.

I have worked on multiple academic and personal projects including frontend website clones, a real-time weather application using REST APIs, and a personal portfolio website 🛠️💡. I also built a Food Delivery System using PHP and MySQL, developed a To-Do List application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and completed several React-based mini projects such as a Counter App, Password Generator App, and other interactive applications. These projects significantly enhanced my practical knowledge and confidence in full-stack and web development 🚀.

My achievements include securing First Position in Coding Contests, earning Golden Badges in C and SQL on HackerRank, and achieving Three Stars in Problem Solving 🏆⭐. I strongly believe in continuous learning, regular practice, and community-driven growth 🤝📘. GeeksforGeeks plays an important role in my journey, helping me learn, practice, and improve every day 😊✨.
